  "ayahuascaInfoTitle": "What is Ayahuasca?",
  "whatIsAyahuascaTitle": "The Ancestral Medicine",
  "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is a sacred brew originating from the Amazon, made from the combination of two plants: the Ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) and the leaves of Chacruna (Psychotria viridis). For centuries, indigenous communities have used it in ceremonies as a tool for physical, emotional, and spiritual healing. It is considered a master plant that teaches and reveals deep aspects of our being.",
  "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How Does It Work?",
  "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "The brew induces a modified state of consciousness, allowing access to the subconscious and spiritual dimensions. During the experience, it is common to have visions, release suppressed emotions, and gain profound clarity about one's life. It is a process of purification and introspection that helps heal traumas, dissolve limiting patterns, and reconnect with one's true essence.",
  "spiritualMasterTitle": "A Spiritual Master",
  "spiritualMasterDescription": "Ayahuasca is not just a substance; it is considered a spiritual guide or master. The experience is a dialogue with this ancient wisdom, where you receive the guidance needed for your personal evolution.
