    "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is an ancestral brew from the Amazon, made from the combination of two sacred plants: the Ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) and the leaves of the Chacruna shrub (Psychotria viridis). For centuries, indigenous communities have used it in ceremonies as a tool for physical, emotional, and spiritual healing, as well as for deep self-knowledge.",
    "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How Does It Work?",
    "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "Ayahuasca acts on the central nervous system, inducing altered states of consciousness that allow access to deep layers of the subconscious. During the experience, it is common to have visions, release suppressed emotions, and gain a clearer understanding of one's life path. The medicine acts as a purifying agent, cleansing the body and spirit of negative energies and emotional blockages.",
    "spiritualMasterTitle": "A Spiritual Master, Not a Drug",
    "spiritualMasterDescription": "It is important to understand that Ayahuasca is not a recreational drug, but a spiritual master plant that demands respect, intention, and proper guidance.
