    "ayahuascaInfoTitle": "The Path of Ayahuasca",
    "whatIsAyahuascaTitle": "What is Ayahuasca?",
    "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is an ancestral Amazonian medicine, a sacred brew made from the combination of two plants: the Ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) and the leaves of the Chacruna shrub (Psychotria viridis). It is known for its profound visionary effects and its ability to facilitate deep emotional, mental, and spiritual healing. At 'The Art of Healing,' we honor this ancient tradition, offering a safe and respectful space for you to experience its transformative power.",
    "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How Does It Work?",
    "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "Ayahuasca works at a neurological level, primarily through the DMT (dimethyltryptamine) present in Chacruna, which is activated by the MAO inhibitors in the vine. This combination allows DMT to access the brain, inducing expanded states of consciousness. During this process, it's common to access deep memories, gain insights into personal patterns, and feel a sense of connection with the universe. It is a powerful tool for self-knowledge and releasing emotional blockages.",
    "spiritualMasterTitle": "A Spiritual Teacher",
    "spiritualMasterDescription": "More than just a substance, Ayahuasca is considered by indigenous cultures to be a teacher or a wise spirit that guides the individual through their inner world. Each ceremony is a unique dialogue with this plant intelligence. It shows you what you need to see, not necessarily what you want to see, in order to heal and grow. Its guidance is loving yet direct, always aiming to lead you toward greater integrity and harmony.",
