  "whatIsAyahuascaTitle": "What is Ayahuasca?",
  "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is an ancestral medicine from the Amazon, a sacred decoction of two plants: the Banisteriopsis caapi vine and the leaves of the Psychotria viridis shrub. Together, they create a powerful brew that opens the doors of perception, allowing for deep introspection and spiritual healing. It is considered a teacher that instructs, purifies, and reconnects the individual with their essence and the universe.",
  "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How Does It Work?",
  "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "On a biochemical level, Ayahuasca combines a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) from the vine with dimethyltryptamine (DMT) from the leaves. This synergy allows DMT, a potent psychoactive compound similar to serotonin, to be orally active and reach the brain. The result is a visionary experience that can last several hours, where deep memories, emotions, and understandings emerge from the subconscious.",
  "spiritualMasterTitle": "A Spiritual Teacher",
  "spiritualMasterDescription": "Beyond chemistry, Ayahuasca is revered as a living intelligence, a spirit of nature that guides the participant on a journey of self-discovery.
