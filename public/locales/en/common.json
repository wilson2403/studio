    "ayahuascaInfoTitle": "The Medicine: Ayahuasca",
    "whatIsAyahuascaTitle": "What is Ayahuasca?",
    "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is an ancestral Amazonian brew, traditionally used by indigenous peoples for spiritual and healing purposes. It's made from the combination of two plants: the Ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) and the leaves of the Chacruna plant (Psychotria viridis).",
    "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How Does It Work?",
    "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "The Chacruna leaves contain Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a powerful psychoactive compound. Normally, DMT is inactive when ingested orally because it's broken down by an enzyme in our stomach called MAO. The Ayahuasca vine contains MAO inhibitors, which allow the DMT to reach the brain, leading to profound visionary and introspective experiences.",
    "spiritualMasterTitle": "A Spiritual Master",
