    "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How Does it Work?",
    "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "The combination of these plants activates DMT in the brain, a molecule that our body naturally produces.

The process is guided to ensure a safe and contained environment for this inner journey.",
    "spiritualMasterTitle": "The Plant as a Spiritual Master",
    "spiritualMasterDescription": "Ayahuasca is considered a master plant that teaches, purifies, and heals.
