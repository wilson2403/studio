  "ayahuascaInfoTitle": "Our Sacred Medicine",
  "whatIsAyahuascaTitle": "What is Ayahuasca?",
  "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is an ancestral Amazonian medicine, a sacred brew prepared from the cooking of two plants: the Banisteriopsis caapi vine and the leaves of the Psychotria viridis shrub. Known as the 'vine of the spirits,' it has been used for centuries by indigenous peoples for healing, spiritual, and self-discovery purposes. Its power lies in its ability to open the doors of perception, allowing for deep introspection and connection with the universe.",
  "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How Does It Work?",
  "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "Ayahuasca acts on a physical, emotional, and spiritual level. The DMT present in the leaves of Psychotria viridis, a potent psychoactive compound, is activated by the MAO inhibitors from the Banisteriopsis caapi vine. This synergy allows the DMT to reach the brain, inducing expanded states of consciousness. During this process, it is common to experience visions, purges (vomiting or diarrhea, considered an energetic cleansing), and profound emotional and spiritual revelations, all within a safe and guided ceremonial space.",
  "spiritualMasterTitle": "A Spiritual Teacher",
  "spiritualMasterDescription": "More than a substance, Ayahuasca is considered a spiritual teacher or a plant intelligence that guides each participant on a unique and personal journey. It reveals what needs to be healed, shows limiting behavior patterns, and helps to reconnect with the purest essence of being. Each ceremony is a sacred conversation with this ancestral wisdom, an opportunity to receive guidance, clarity, and deep healing.",
