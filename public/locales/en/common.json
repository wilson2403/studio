    "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is a sacred ancestral brew from the Amazon, traditionally used by indigenous communities for healing and spiritual exploration.

    "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "The Chacruna leaves contain DMT, a powerful psychoactive compound, while the Ayahuasca vine contains harmala alkaloids that act as MAO inhibitors.
