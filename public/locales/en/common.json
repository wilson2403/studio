    "whatIsAyahuascaTitle": "What is Ayahuasca?",
    "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is an ancestral psychoactive brew from the Amazon, traditionally used for spiritual and healing purposes. It is prepared by combining the Banisteriopsis caapi vine and the leaves of the Psychotria viridis shrub, which together activate its visionary properties. It is a tool for deep introspection, emotional release, and spiritual connection.",
    "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How does it work?",
    "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "The experience with Ayahuasca, often called a 'mareación,' is a profound journey into the subconscious. It can bring forth repressed memories, reveal unconscious patterns, and offer deep insights into one's life purpose. The process is guided by sacred songs (icaros) that help direct and modulate the energy of the ceremony, facilitating healing and transformation.",
    "spiritualMasterTitle": "A Spiritual Master, Not a Drug",
    "spiritualMasterDescription": "It is crucial to approach Ayahuasca with respect and a clear intention. It is not a recreational substance but a master plant that teaches, heals, and guides. The experience can be challenging, as it confronts us with our deepest shadows, but it is through this process that true liberation and understanding are found.",
