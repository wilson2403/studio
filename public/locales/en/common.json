This mixture, used for centuries in shamanic rituals, induces altered states of consciousness that allow for deep introspection, emotional healing, and spiritual connection.",
  "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How does it work?",
  "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "The medicine works on a physical, emotional, and spiritual level, cleansing the body of toxins and the mind of limiting patterns.

The process is guided to ensure a safe and respectful environment.",
