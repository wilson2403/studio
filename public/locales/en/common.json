  "whatIsAyahuascaTitle": "What is Ayahuasca?",
  "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is an ancestral Amazonian medicine, a sacred brew resulting from the cooking of two plants: the Ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) and the leaves of Chacruna (Psychotria viridis). Together, they create a potent concoction that opens the doors of perception, facilitating deep healing on a physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual level.",
  "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How does it work?",
  "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "Ayahuasca acts as a catalyst for introspection.
