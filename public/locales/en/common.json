    "whatIsAyahuascaTitle": "What is Ayahuasca?",
    "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca, also known as the 'vine of the soul,' is a sacred psychoactive brew originating from the Amazon rainforest. It has been used for centuries by indigenous communities for spiritual healing and divination. The brew combines the Banisteriopsis caapi vine and the leaves of the Psychotria viridis shrub, which work together to induce profound visionary experiences and deep introspection.",
    "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How Does It Work?",
    "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "The primary psychoactive compound in Ayahuasca is DMT, which, when combined with the MAOI from the caapi vine, becomes orally active. This allows for an extended journey, typically lasting 4 to 6 hours. During this time, individuals may experience vivid visions, emotional release, and a heightened sense of connection to themselves and the universe. It is a powerful tool for confronting past traumas, resolving internal conflicts, and gaining clarity on one's life path.",
    "spiritualMasterTitle": "A Spiritual Master",
    "spiritualMasterDescription": "Ayahuasca is often referred to as a 'master plant' or a 'teacher' because it guides individuals through their inner landscapes, revealing truths and providing insights that can be life-altering. The experience is deeply personal and unique to each individual, offering what is needed for their specific healing and growth.",
