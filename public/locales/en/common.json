    "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is an ancestral medicine from the Amazon jungle, prepared by mixing two plants: the Banisteriopsis caapi vine and the leaves of the Psychotria viridis shrub. Known as the “vine of the soul,” this sacred brew has been used for centuries in shamanic rituals for physical, emotional, and spiritual healing, and to expand consciousness.",
    "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How does it work?",
    "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "Ayahuasca works on a biochemical and spiritual level. It contains DMT, a compound that opens the doors to a deeper perception of reality, allowing for introspection, trauma release, and a connection with the subconscious. Each experience is unique, guided by the wisdom of the plant and the participant's intention.",
    "spiritualMasterTitle": "A spiritual master",
    "spiritualMasterDescription": "Ayahuasca is considered a master teacher that instructs through visions, emotions, and revelations.
