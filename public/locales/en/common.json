    "whatIsAyahuascaTitle": "What is Ayahuasca?",
    "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is an ancestral Amazonian medicine, a sacred brew resulting from the cooking of two master plants: the Ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) and Chacruna leaves (Psychotria viridis). This visionary beverage has been used for centuries by indigenous peoples as a tool for physical, emotional, and spiritual healing, and to connect with the wisdom of the universe.",
    "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How does it work?",
    "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "Ayahuasca acts as a purgative for the body, mind, and soul. On a biochemical level, the DMT from Chacruna (a potent visionary) is activated by the MAO inhibitors in the vine, allowing for a deep introspective experience. In this expanded state of consciousness, you can access repressed memories, understand behavioral patterns, and release emotional blockages, opening the way to comprehensive healing.",
    "spiritualMasterTitle": "A Spiritual Master",
    "spiritualMasterDescription": "More than a substance, Ayahuasca is considered a living intelligence, a master that teaches and guides. Each ceremony is a unique dialogue with this ancestral wisdom, offering the lessons you most need in your present moment. It shows you what you need to see, not necessarily what you want to see, always with a purpose of growth and love.",
