    "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is an ancestral Amazonian medicine, a sacred brew prepared from the decoction of two plants: the Ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) and the leaves of the Chacruna shrub (Psychotria viridis). This brew has been used for centuries by indigenous peoples for healing, spiritual, and self-discovery purposes. Its name means “rope of the spirits” or “vine of the soul” in Quechua.",
    "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How Does It Work?",
    "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "Ayahuasca induces expanded states of consciousness, allowing access to deep levels of the subconscious. This process facilitates the release of emotional blockages, the healing of traumas, and a greater understanding of oneself and the universe. It acts as a mirror of the soul, revealing patterns of thought and behavior that limit our potential, and opening the door to lasting transformation.",
    "spiritualMasterTitle": "The Medicine as a Spiritual Master",
