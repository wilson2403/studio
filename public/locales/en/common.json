    "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is a sacred ancestral brew from the Amazon, made from the combination of two plants: the Ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) and the Chacruna leaves (Psychotria viridis). For centuries, indigenous communities have used it in ceremonies to connect with the spiritual world, find guidance, and heal deep emotional and physical ailments.",

    "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "The brew induces a modified state of consciousness, allowing for profound introspection and the release of emotional blockages.

The experience is both challenging and deeply revealing.",

    "spiritualMasterDescription": "Ayahuasca is considered a master plant, a wise teacher that guides each person in a unique and personalized way.
