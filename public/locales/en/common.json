    "whatIsAyahuascaTitle": "What is Ayahuasca?",
    "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is an ancestral Amazonian medicine, a sacred brew obtained from the cooking of two plants: the Ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) and the leaves of the Chacruna shrub (Psychotria viridis). In tradition, it is known as the 'rope of the spirits,' a bridge to the inner and spiritual world.",
    "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How does it work?",
    "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "Chacruna contains Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a visionary molecule that our body naturally produces. The Ayahuasca vine, in turn, contains monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) that allow DMT to be activated in the brain, opening the door to deep introspection, emotional healing, and expansion of consciousness.",
    "spiritualMasterTitle": "The Medicine as a Spiritual Teacher",
    "spiritualMasterDescription": "Ayahuasca is not a drug, but a teacher. It works on multiple levels: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual.
