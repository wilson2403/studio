    "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is a sacred ancestral beverage from the Amazon, created by combining two plants: the Ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) and the leaves of Chacruna (Psychotria viridis). For centuries, indigenous communities have used it in spiritual ceremonies to facilitate deep healing, self-knowledge, and connection with the divine.",
    "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How Does It Work?",
    "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "The combination of these plants activates dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in the brain, a molecule that our body naturally produces. This activation opens a door to the subconscious, allowing us to access memories, emotions, and profound states of consciousness that are normally hidden. It's not a hallucination, but a state of expanded consciousness.",
    "spiritualMasterTitle": "A Spiritual Master, Not a Drug",
    "spiritualMasterDescription": "Ayahuasca is not a recreational substance; it is a spiritual master that guides us with love and wisdom. In a ceremonial context, led by experienced guides, it becomes a powerful tool for confronting fears, healing emotional wounds, releasing blockages, and rediscovering our purpose in life. It is an act of courage and a gift of love to oneself.",
