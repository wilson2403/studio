    "whatIsAyahuascaTitle": "A Sacred Ancestral Medicine",
    "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is a sacred psychoactive brew originating from the Amazon. It is composed of two plants: the Ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) and the leaves of the Chacruna plant (Psychotria viridis). For centuries, indigenous cultures have used it in ceremonial contexts for healing, divination, and spiritual connection.",
    "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How Does It Work?",
    "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "The combination of plants allows the psychoactive component, DMT (from Chacruna), to be active when ingested orally. This induces altered states of consciousness, often characterized by introspection, deep emotional release, and profound spiritual insights. The experience is guided by the spirit of the plant, which is considered a master teacher.",
    "spiritualMasterTitle": "A Spiritual Master",
    "spiritualMasterDescription": "We approach Ayahuasca with deep respect, viewing it not as a substance, but as a wise and ancient teacher.
