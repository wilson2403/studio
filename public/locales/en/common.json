    "ayahuascaInfoTitle": "The Healing Power of Ayahuasca",
    "whatIsAyahuascaTitle": "What is Ayahuasca?",
    "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is an ancestral medicine from the Amazon rainforest, a sacred brew made from the decoction of two plants: the Ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) and the leaves of the Chacruna shrub (Psychotria viridis). This brew has been used for centuries by indigenous peoples for healing, spiritual, and divination purposes. It acts as a gateway to the subconscious, allowing for deep introspection, trauma release, and a greater connection with oneself and the universe.",
    "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How does it work?",
    "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "Chacruna contains Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a powerful visionary compound that already exists in our brain. However, our body quickly breaks it down thanks to the MAO enzyme. The Ayahuasca vine acts as an MAO inhibitor (MAOI), allowing DMT to reach the brain and activate its effects. This biochemical interaction opens the doors to an experience that can be profoundly revealing and transformative.",
    "spiritualMasterTitle": "A Spiritual Teacher",
    "spiritualMasterDescription": "More than a substance, Ayahuasca is considered by indigenous cultures as a spiritual teacher or a wise entity. It is said that 'Mother Ayahuasca' teaches, guides, and purifies. During the ceremony, participants often report receiving visions, insights, and messages that help them heal emotional wounds, understand behavioral patterns, and find their life's purpose.",
