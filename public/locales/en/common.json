It has been used for centuries in traditional spiritual ceremonies by indigenous peoples for healing, divination, and spiritual awakening. The brew is typically made from the Banisteriopsis caapi vine and the leaves of the Psychotria viridis shrub, which together create a powerful entheogenic experience.",
  "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How Does It Work?",

It is known to help individuals confront and heal from past traumas, overcome personal blockages, and gain a deeper understanding of themselves and the universe.",
  "spiritualMasterTitle": "A Spiritual Master, Not a Drug",

It is a journey into the depths of one's own consciousness.",
