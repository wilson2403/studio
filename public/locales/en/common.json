  "ayahuascaInfoTitle": "The Medicine",
  "whatIsAyahuascaTitle": "What is Ayahuasca?",
  "whatIsAyahuascaDescription": "Ayahuasca is an ancient Amazonian medicine, a sacred brew prepared from the decoction of two plants: the Ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) and the leaves of the Chacruna shrub (Psychotria viridis). This unique combination not only opens the doors to deep introspection but has also been used for centuries by indigenous peoples for physical, emotional, and spiritual healing.",
  "howAyahuascaWorksTitle": "How Does It Work?",
  "howAyahuascaWorksDescription": "Ayahuasca works on a biochemical and spiritual level. Chacruna contains Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a visionary molecule that our own brain produces. The Ayahuasca vine contains monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which allow DMT to be orally active. This synergy facilitates an expanded state of consciousness, allowing you to access deep memories, heal traumas, and receive guidance from within.",
  "spiritualMasterTitle": "A Spiritual Teacher",
  "spiritualMasterDescription": "More than a substance, Ayahuasca is considered a spiritual teacher or a plant intelligence that guides each participant on a unique and personalized journey.
