## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft green (#A7D1AB) to evoke nature and healing.
- Background color: Creamy white (#FAF9F6), desaturated from the primary, providing a calming backdrop.
- Accent color: Pale gold (#D4AF37), an analogous color, to represent spirituality and subtle highlights.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (humanist sans-serif) for headlines and short chunks of text, and 'Alegreya' (humanist serif) for longer passages of body text. These will convey elegance, readability, and a blend of modernity with a touch of tradition.
- Use rounded borders and soft shadows on visual elements to enhance the modern and inviting feel.
- Incorporate subtle fade-in animations for content blocks to create a smooth and engaging user experience.
